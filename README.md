## 📚 Learning Objectives

Each game teaches specific physics concepts from the high school curriculum:

- **Kinematics**: v² = v₀² + 2as, free fall, projectile motion
- **Dynamics**: Newton's laws, F = ma, friction
- **Energy**: Kinetic & potential energy, conservation
- **Momentum**: Impulse, collisions, Δp = FΔt
- **Electricity**: Ohm's Law, circuits, power
- **Waves**: Sound waves, frequency, wavelength
- **Gravity**: Universal gravitation, orbital mechanics

## 📖 Story: Mission ATLAS

Year 2157. The spacecraft *Prometheus* is stranded near Neptune after a solar flare damaged its systems. The only hope is *Mission ATLAS* — a daring rescue that requires perfect physics calculations.

You are the "Calculator", a young scientist at ISA (International Space Agency). Use the laws of physics to complete each mission and save the crew!
